I believe in a holistic approach to therapy, all parts of us affect our whole being! Wellness and recovery happen when we take into consideration all these parts, if we disregard any part we cannot be fully well. I strive to support you on your journey to wellness in a way that is best suited to you.

        A little about myself, I am married with 3 grown humans who have all left home. We have a Newfoundland and are grandparents to a Cavapoo. I have a crazy large extended family, with many family members being neurodivergent. I love getting outside, walking, enjoying the countryside, going to the theatre, having adventures, good food, going to the gym and generally challenging myself. 
I also share caring responsibilities for my mother-in-law who suffers from dementia and lives in her own little home in our garden.

      <p class="ff-body">
 I have been working in a therapeutic manner for over five years with three years of training before that, before my training and during I worked with children and young people in a variety of settings, including as a SEN TA, pastoral lead in a specialist behavioural school, tutoring in a children’s home and volunteering in Girl Guiding. 
Since qualifying I have worked in a variety of settings as a counsellor including a primary school, high school and specialist behavioural school alongside my private practice. I now volunteer at Air Cadets as their training and wellbeing officer.
